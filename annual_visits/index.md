# Annual Physical Exam for Adults

Other preventive templates (to be developed):

* Older adults / geriatrics
* Pregnant women
* Gay men
* Patients with HIV
* Cancer survivors
* Patients with diabetes

Great summary tables are available for [adults](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image?imageKey=PC%2F72728&topicKey=PC%2F7574&search=annual%20physical%20exam&rank=1~150&source=see_link) and [older adults](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image?imageKey=PC%2F75220&topicKey=PC%2F7574&search=annual%20physical%20exam&rank=1~150&source=see_link) in UpToDate (subscription required).

In creating a format to allow providers to build consensus, we are starting with a plain text format that could be used as a *smart phrase* within text expander systems.
