# The Problem

Primary care providers do not have effective, pragmatic, succinct point-of-care diagnosis and treatment resources that are adapted to their local clinic and standards of excellence, resulting in increased cognitive load, duplicated and error prone adoption of best practices, and patients not receive the best possible local care.

## Background

Providing quality care requires 2 core elements:

1. effectively treating the current condition(s)
2. providing appropriate preventive care to improve or maintain health

As a primary care doctor, we would like to provide the most effective care possible for each individual patient. In order to do so we need to 

* understand the patients unique circumstances, including their health history as well as their values and preferences
* know the best diagnostic and treatment options available - their expected benefit, possible harms, cost and limitations
* be able to skillfully deliver this test, or treatment within the local context

2 major challenges for the practice of medicine are:

* increasing complexity
* inherent uncertainty (most medical choices are probabilistic, most decisions cannot be evidence based given other variables involved)

As such, we have a number of mechanisms to help us manage this complexity:

* Medical organizations synthesize the evidence and develop guidelines, such as the American College of Physicians
* Organizations such as UpToDate and Dynamed work to create clinical summaries that are updated and synthesize this.

However, there is sometimes conflicting interpretations of data that are possible, there are local population differences that can be possible, and there are significant practice variations that are possible (including clinical organization policies, or formularies that limit the applicability of some of these resources). 

At the point of care, the most succinct and appropriate to the local context resource would be most valuable.

# A Proposed Solution

I propose to

* create collaborative/reviewable/updateable/trackable documents that will:
  * create shorter and simpler point of care guidelines adapted to the local clinic, patient population and available resources
  * a means to capture the collected wisdom of the clinic providers to create a standard of excellence which can be
    * collaboratively created (with editorial controls)
    * can track changes
    * can allow individual customization (with sharing back of the customization)

# Topics

We will start with a small initial number of conditions which need local adaptation, focusing initially on annual or preventive visits.

See the [README](https://narath.github.com/bestpractices/README.md) in the github repository for the current list of topics.

# Challenges

These will need to be monitored and reviewed regularly.
